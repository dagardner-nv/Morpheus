    Test for MRC issue #362 where `gc.collect()` is invoked while a thread is being finalized and thus
    thread-local storage has already been cleared, when this happens and `gc.collect()` collects an object who's
    destructor makes use of pybind11's `gil_scoped_acquire` then an internal pybind11 error is triggered.

    Specifically the destructor for `PyDataTable` makes use of `gil_scoped_acquire` to release the GIL to allow the
    underlying dataframe to be freed by the python interpreter.

    The easiest was to reproduce this is to run a pipeline with C++ mode enabled wehre the sink like
    `InMemorySinkStage` holds on to a reference to the message not allowing it to be garbage collected until after the
    pipeline has finished running. Then run a second pipeline in either C++ or Python mode, where once of the stages
    has a finalizer on the thread which calls `gc.collect` specifically `cupy.fft` does this and I was unable to repro
    the issue myself, possibly since that code was written in cython.

    This only works if the first pipeline and thus the `PyDataTable` are not gargabe collected before the second
    pipeline is collected which makes this difficult to reproduce, but it is possible to force the issue by disabling
    automatic garbage collection.
